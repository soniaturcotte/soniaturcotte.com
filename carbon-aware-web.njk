    <h1 class="small-text post-title">Carbon aware web</h2>
    <p>This website has been designed to minimise the energy consumption and CO2 emissions that result from navigating the internet.</p>

    <p>It is a static site built with Eleventy and hosted on Netlify. The interface uses system typefaces (Arial and Times New Roman) to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests. Images are optimised as .webp and implement lazy loading to decreases bandwidth.</p>

    <h2 class="small-text section-heading">Coming next</h2>

    <p>A website is a constant work in progress and I’m still learning. There are several things I’m still working on:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Serve responsive images via <a href="">Netlify</a></li>
      <li>Move all blog post images into site and optimise</li>
      <li>In the future, I may implement dithered images, inspired by <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/#how">Low Tech Magazine</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any other ideas or examples, please <a href="mailto:sonia.turcotte@gmail.com">share them with me</a>.</p>

   <h2 class="small-text section-heading">Inspiration</h2>

    <p>I am collecting guides, research and examples on <a href="">Are.na</a>.</p>
