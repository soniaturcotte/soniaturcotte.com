I’ve been thinking about moving off Spotify for literal years. It’s shit. For musicians, for cultural diversity, and tbh, it’s increasingly shit for discovery. 

What finally pushed me, I’m not proud to admit, was not ethics but a duo of terrible user experiences. 

1. I had an open collab playlist and some random user deleted all my songs and added like 7 random shit albums – those kind of generic, no-name “bands” that I’m certain are just made-up algorithmic bullshit created so Spotify doesn’t have to pay anyone.
2. I accidentally added ALL Bach’s cello suites to the wrong playlist and it was a pain in the ass to fix. 

It was time to go.

I did a bit of investigating and [asking around](https://bsky.app/profile/soniaturcotte.bsky.social/post/3ksgw2hraok2h) and ended up with Tidal + radio. 

Apparently, [Tidal pays musicians the most](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/which-streaming-platform-pays-musicians-most/). I was part of a Spotify family plan, paying £5/month. Tidal costs £10/month, a small enough bump to be worth it. There is a transfer service and it was incredibly easy to port all my playlists over. There were only 2 songs it couldn’t find, a Punjabi tune and a niche Gill Scott-Heron song. A minor sacrifice. 

Previously, I had got into the boring habit of relying on Spotify daylists and discover weekly for random listening. But over time, everything starts to sound the same. 

Many have written about the reliance on algorithms acting as a flattening of culture<label for="sn-flattening-culture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">For example, <a href="https://www.kylechayka.com/filterworld">Filterworld by Kyle Chayka</a></span>. You just get served more of what you already consume. 

In my asking around, someone recommended [Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com/). It’s free, there are no ads and they have a few different stations so you’ve got something for different moods. It has a skip button.

Now, when I don’t have a particular artist in mind, I put on the radio. It is a good antidote to algorithmic bore<label for="sn-radio" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

It’s been about a month since I stopped using Spotify and I dig it. I’m listening better music and I get that nice smug feeling that comes from not using a shitty ubiquitous platform. 

I also have a get-out-of-jail-free card when Oasis comes on in the office. It’s the radio, Eliot.
