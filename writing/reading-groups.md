Ruth Wilson Gilmore says that reading groups are [‘one of the most beautiful pastimes there is on Earth’](https://onbeing.org/programs/ruth-wilson-gilmore-where-life-is-precious-life-is-precious/). I couldn’t agree more.

I started my first group, a book club, with a tweet (rip) in January 2018. A bunch of people responded, we set up a Whatsapp group and off we went. 

Over nearly four years together (!!), we read… 

- *Lincoln in the Bardo* by George Saunders
- *How to survive the plague* by David France
- *Flights* by Olga Tokarczuk
- *So Lucky* by Nicola Griffith
- *Sing, Unburied, Sing* by Jesmyn Ward
- *Milkman* by Anna Burns
- *Heart of the Race* by Beverley Bryan
- *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante
- *The Book of Sarah* by Sarah Lightman
- *Lowborn* by Kerry Hudson
- *The Rings of Saturn* by W. G. Sebald
- *Hag-Seed* by Margaret Atwood
- *The Mushroom at the End of the World* by Anna Tsing
- *The Outline* by Rachel Cusk
- *Inner City Pressure* by Dan Hancox
- *Parable of the Sower* by Octavia Butler
- *The Topeka School* by Ben Lerner
- *The Three Body Problem* by Liu Cixin
- *Scoff* by Pen Vogler
- *Freshwater* by Akwaeke Emezi
- *Queenie* by Candice Carty-Williams 

Cor! What a list. <br /> 
(I had to scroll through so many messages to compile this.) 

There was a slight fluctuation of members throughout, but the core group – Amy, Angus, Becky, Eliot, Jon, Liv, Lucy – were just brilliant. Many of them are writers, which really enriched the discussion and made me think about reading in a different way. Everyone brought such thoughtfulness, feeling and depth to the discussion. 

To share this magical space, even during a global pandemic, was a gift.

My current group started in February this year with my wonderful friend Marina, from my second MA at Goldsmiths. We invited people we had met over our studies, so there is a certain shared theoretical lineage. 

So far we’ve read… 

- ‘Nothing Comes Without Its World’: Thinking with Care by María Puig de la Bellacasa
- Introduction, *The Government of Beans* by Kregg Hetherington
- Part 1, *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments* by Sadiya Hartman
- Introduction, *Abolition Geography* by Ruth Wilson Gilmore
- Introduction, *Azadi* by Arundhati Roy
- Ch 4, *Life Besides Itself* &nbsp;by Lisa Stevenson
- Ch 1, *Animal Biographies* by Eric Baratay

We take turns meeting, usually monthly, at different people’s homes. It’s lovely and intimate.

It is a place to discuss ideas and theories, but also a place to poke at questions of knowledge production. Maybe sometimes even a place to explore who we are – as individuals and a collective. A place to consider what it means to be human.

We talk about the text, but also about trauma and joy, childhood experiences and family, dreams and yearnings, the thoughts that keep you up at night. We gossip a lot. 

It is generous and nourishing and challenging.

I struggle describe what it means to me. Is it irony that when I’m trying to write about a space centred around writing, words fail me? When I think of this space I share – Arianne, Marina, Martin, Pei-Chi, Rachel and Toby – I am overwhelmed with love. Love for the people, yes. But also for being alive. 

All the struggle and torment of living is worth it for moments like these. Reading and talking and eating and drinking ... is this a buen vivir? 

There’s a bit from [*The Undercommons*](https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf) that I quote all the time, where Fred Moten says,  

> When I think about the way we use the term ‘study,’ I think we are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice.


I have the words ‘study forever’ tattooed on my arm for a reason.

I’m reminded of the title of a painting by [Egon Schiele](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egon_Schiele_-_I_Will_Gladly_Endure_for_Art_and_My_Loved_Ones,_1912_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg):

Reading groups are study and art and loved ones. Reading groups are one of the forms of sociality that, for me, make a life that is worth dying for.
