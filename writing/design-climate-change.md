This website, my little hand-coded project, does not score very well on those [digital climate calculators](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). Mostly because of large images, and because I never learned how to serve smaller image sizes based on device.

I’ve been thinking that I’m due a website refresh. It’s been a couple of years since this version came to being and aside from it’s carbon footprint, it also doesn’t reflect all the different things I get up to. 

It’s going to take me a while to get around to actually doing the work because I’m in the middle of PhD applications and that already is a part-time job. But it will be a good winter project. If I say I'm going to do it in the wild (here), then I have to do it, right? 

## Some inspiration

- I’m especially motivated by [Rod’s work](https://www.holdfastprojects.com/carbon) and friendship. Seriously, browse his website and read everything because it is great. 
- [Victor’s](https://www.victorhwang.work/)  stunning, ecologically conscious website Mater. Read about it in [It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/victor-hwang-mater-project-graphic-design-071122).
- Websites like [Formafantasma](https://formafantasma.com/website). They make Times New Roman and Arial look good. 
- [Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), which goes a step further and removes the font-family declaration altogether, along with a bunch of [other cool shit](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/).

I’m already running a static site through 11ty and don’t have any analytics, but the two new requirements of a redesign will be: 

1. System or default typeface(s)
2. Better image handling to reduce bandwidth

If you have any other ideas or examples, please [share them with me](mailto:sonia.turcotte@gmail.com). 

Another internet is possible. Let’s build it.
