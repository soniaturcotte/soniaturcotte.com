I recently wrote about some work with [FF Studio at the V&A](/digital-garden/vam-intranet), which had me thinking about other no/low-code websites I’ve made in the last few years. I’ve worked with almost every platform you’ve heard of, and some you probably haven’t<label for="sn-platform" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-platform" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">NHS Futures anyone?</span>.

## Webflow for ICCT 

One of my favourite independent projects was for a new collective, the [Institute for Contemporary Critical Thought](https://www.contemporarycriticalthought.org/). I’m one of the founding members, so it was a labour of love across brand, visual design and the website<label for="sn-feedback-ideas" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-feedback-ideas" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Lots of help in the form of ideas and feedback from other members of the team, especially [Marina](https://bsky.app/profile/marinaionita.bsky.social).</span>. 


I built it on Webflow because we needed a CMS that other members could update and would accommodate events and long-form posts. It was my first time working with Webflow and it was a learning curve, but I was impressed by how much I could achieve without any engineering help.

## No-code platforms

I made a little writing website with Readymag for my multi-talented friend [Alex](https://alexandermcmaster.com/). What he wanted was quite simple, but I’m keen to push the capabilities of Readymag in the future.

I’ve explored Notion publishing, both as-is and using Super. One example is [Transform your work](https://transformyour.work/). There was also a community-organisating project that sadly never took off, but I was really excited about the collaborative potential of that kind of project using Notion. 

Everyone in the world has used Squarespace (probably). I’ve done my share over the years, mostly recently helping [Iswe](https://www.iswe.org/) with a campaign site for global assemblies. However, I don’t usually recommend it to my clients because all Squarespace websites look the same. It’s also expensive and a pain in the ass.

## Hand-coded with love 

My favourite kind of website is the hand-coded one, like this one you are reading on. It’s [carbon friendly](/carbon-aware-web/). It feels like old-school internet. It is, to me, an antidote to the bloated, AI-everywhere internet all around us<label for="sn-handcoded" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-handcoded" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I’m working on another one at the moment and will share when it’s live.</span>.

I love making websites for the weird wild web. It’s so fun. Maybe you want a website? [Let’s chat](mailto:soniaturcotte@proton.me).
