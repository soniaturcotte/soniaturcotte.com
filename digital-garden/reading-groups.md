Ruth Wilson Gilmore says that reading groups are [‘one of the most beautiful pastimes there is on Earth’](https://onbeing.org/programs/ruth-wilson-gilmore-where-life-is-precious-life-is-precious/). I couldn’t agree more.

I started my first group, a book club, with a tweet (rip) in January 2018. A bunch of people responded, we set up a Whatsapp group and off we went. 

Over nearly four years together (!!), we read… 

- *Lincoln in the Bardo* by George Saunders
- *How to survive the plague* by David France
- *Flights* by Olga Tokarczuk
- *So Lucky* by Nicola Griffith
- *Sing, Unburied, Sing* by Jesmyn Ward
- *Milkman* by Anna Burns
- *Heart of the Race* by Beverley Bryan
- *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante
- *The Book of Sarah* by Sarah Lightman
- *Lowborn* by Kerry Hudson
- *The Rings of Saturn* by W. G. Sebald
- *Hag-Seed* by Margaret Atwood
- *The Mushroom at the End of the World* by Anna Tsing
- *The Outline* by Rachel Cusk
- *Inner City Pressure* by Dan Hancox
- *Parable of the Sower* by Octavia Butler
- *The Topeka School* by Ben Lerner
- *The Three Body Problem* by Liu Cixin
- *Scoff* by Pen Vogler
- *Freshwater* by Akwaeke Emezi
- *Queenie* by Candice Carty-Williams 

Cor! What a list.

There was a slight fluctuation of members throughout, but the core group – Amy, Angus, Becky, Eliot, Jon, Liv, Lucy – were just brilliant. Many of them are writers, which really enriched the texts and made me think about reading in a different way. 

Everyone brought such thoughtfulness, feeling and depth to the discussion. To share this magical space, even during a global pandemic, was a gift.

My current reading group started in February this year with my wonderful friend Marina, from my second MA at Goldsmiths. We invited people we had met over our studies, so we share a certain theoretical lineage. 

So far we’ve read… 

- ‘Nothing Comes Without Its World’: Thinking with Care by María Puig de la Bellacasa
- Introduction, *The Government of Beans* by Kregg Hetherington
- Part 1, *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments* by Sadiya Hartman
- Introduction, *Abolition Geography* by Ruth Wilson Gilmore
- Introduction, *Azadi* by Arundhati Roy
- Ch 4, *Life Besides Itself* &nbsp;by Lisa Stevenson
- Ch 1, *Animal Biographies* by Eric Baratay

We take turns meeting, usually monthly, at different people’s homes. It’s lovely and intimate.

It is a place to discuss ideas and theories, but also a place to poke at questions of knowledge production. Maybe sometimes even a place to explore who we are – as individuals and a collective. A place to consider what it means to be human.

We talk about the text, but also about childhood experiences, family, dreams and desires, about our trauma but also our joy. We share the thoughts that keep us up at night. We gossip a&nbsp;lot. 

It is generous and nourishing and challenging.

When I think of this space I share – with Arianne, Marina, Martin, Pei-Chi, Rachel and Toby – I am overwhelmed with love. Love for the people, yes. But also for life. 

All the struggle and torment of being alive is worth it for moments like these. Reading and talking and eating and drinking ... is this a buen vivir? 

There’s a quote from [*The Undercommons*](https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf) that I cite all the time, where Fred Moten says,  

> When I think about the way we use the term ‘study,’ I think we are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice.


I have the words ‘study forever’ tattooed on my body for a reason.

I’m also reminded of the title of a painting by [Egon Schiele](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egon_Schiele_-_I_Will_Gladly_Endure_for_Art_and_My_Loved_Ones,_1912_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg):

At their best, reading groups are art and loved ones. Reading groups comprise a form of sociality that, for me, make up a life that is worth dying for.

I think I might start another one.
