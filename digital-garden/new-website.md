It’s actually been live for a few months but I wanted to write a little about this new site, following on from the original post about [creating a digital garden](/digital-garden/making-a-tiny-digital-garden) and later, my desire to make the site more [carbon aware](/digital-garden/design-climate-change). 

The actual design and build aims to minimise energy consumption – which you can read about on [this dedicated page](/carbon-aware-web/). The previous design scored terribly on carbon calculators, mostly because of images. This one ... it’s A+ baby!

  <figcaption class="small-text">Before and after</figcaption>
</figure>

I mourned a little over using default typefaces but it’s worth it. Back-to-basics web design and carbon aware principles doesn’t have to be ugly. And I’ve had great feedback.

The first one says: ‘love the design, all websites should be like this not only is it better in terms of power consumption, but god it’s so good on the eyes and a breeze to navigate’ the second says ‘I made a website. Your low carbon one inspired me to make one’">

There was another motivation to restructure things, and that was to create a space more constitutive of my practice. 

My previous site was basically a mini-portfolio for full-time design work. Now that I’m freelance, I tend to take on projects with greater variety. And I've added research to my arsenal<label for="sn-unicorn" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-unicorn" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.ff.studio">FF Studio</a> calls me a unicorn lol I will take it</span>. I also wanted a space to share self-directed projects and work outside of tech. And I’m starting a PhD in September (!!) so who knows what will come from that? 

It’s nice to have a place to tinker with, that can grow with me. As [Laurel Schwulst](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/) says, 

> If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us.
