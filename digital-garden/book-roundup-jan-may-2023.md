A short list of the most memorable books of the year so far, excluding academic texts. If you are interested in apocalyptic thought or animal studies, give me a shout and I’ll share some recs. You can see the full list of what I’ve read this year on [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/soniaturcotte?year=2023).


### [Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ec237398-e980-4326-96e5-72419947dfe9) by Saidiya Hartman

One of the most beautiful books of the year. Hartman is powerful. Words that stay with you. 

If you need convincing, start with [The Plot of Her Undoing](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c805bf0d86cc90a02b81cdc/t/5db8b219a910fa05af05dbf4/1572385305368/NotesOnFeminism-2_SaidiyaHartman.pdf), [The End of White Supremacy](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/the-end-of-white-supremacy-an-american-romance/) or [this interview](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/saidiya-hartman-on-working-with-archives/)

### [We Do This 'til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/13c6d82e-e1eb-4c9d-b31d-fc2fbd21f80a) by Mariame Kaba

A collection of essays and articles by Kaba and collaborators. Abolitionist thought and practice has been and is hugely influential on my thinking and politics. Kaba is unwavering in dealing with the difficult questions of abolition.  

### [Small Fires: An Epic in the Kitchen](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4d84cf99-722b-429c-ba4a-d06dcc5f3fb1) by Rebecca May Johnson

I am obsessed with food. The two newsletters I read most faithfully are [Alicia Kennedy](https://www.aliciakennedy.news/) and [Vittles](https://vittles.substack.com/).

RMJ’s visceral, affective account of food and cooking is wonderful, as is her red sauce which I made and enjoyed for weeks after. 



### [Maps of Our Spectacular Bodies](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cd8072ab-b78e-4f07-b4b3-9d3a9e2b7543) by Maddie Mortimer

Sharp, moving, devastating. There are difficult themes aplenty so you are prone to triggers, read the synopsis first. I, for one, like to use literature as a grater on my wounds. 

### [The Passenger Series](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/1259033) by Cormac McCarthy and [Gun Island](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5aecee42-18cf-4c71-a1bb-d0d206dca248) by Amitav Ghosh

While also good stories, well written and therefore likely enjoyable to a larger audience, I recommend these novels especially to those mystically inclined. 

I read them while learning Tarot and reading pluralist literature – [The Will to Believe](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26659/26659-h/26659-h.htm) by William James and [Around the Day in Eighty Worlds](https://www.dukeupress.edu/around-the-day-in-eighty-worlds) by Martin Savransky – and for a few weeks, the whole world was awash in magick.

### [Worlds of Exile and Illusion](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4b2cc41e-72b2-48cf-93a3-d78e1e70072e) and [The Wind's Twelve Quarters and The Compass Rose](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3445ee68-6a88-46f3-93de-307c5e0597cb) by Ursula K. Le Guin

I love everything I’ve read by Le Guin so far, without exception. Nothing else to add.
