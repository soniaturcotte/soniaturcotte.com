Somewhere between a blog and a journal, a digital garden is a place to think through writing, through connecting and linking with other ideas. It is a place for learning. Over time, in public.

To quote the well-known [Caulfield talk](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

I had a newsletter originally, all the rage these days. But I was unhappy with Substack’s data tracking and the move to Buttondown never stuck – it was unbearably ugly and the impetus for a regular cadence felt too much after a while. 

[Denise](https://walknotes.com/2023/05/20/15-19-may/) says, after Matt Ruby, that blogging is dead. Ah well. I like blogs. Every new post on the blogs I follow – [Denise](https://walknotes.com/), [Gemma](https://gemmacope.land/writing/), [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes), [Victor](https://victorhwang.co/) – is a little treat. Good company to be in, imo. 

And since this little garden doesn’t have any tracking, I will never know who, if anyone, is reading. Standard data practices have made creepy behaviour the norm and I am absolutely not here for it.

In [_A Handmade Web_](https://luckysoap.com/talks.html), J. R. Carpenter says

> I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance.

Resistance to social media giants, multinational corporations, data-saturated systems and surveillance technologies. 

I don’t know what shape this will take, but it’s a garden for small thoughts, occasional musings, nascent ideas and  slow learning.
