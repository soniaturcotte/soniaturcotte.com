I didn’t start the year with this goal. It was, as always, 52 books, one per week. Enough to make me choose a book over Netflix, but that not much of a stretch. 

January kicked off with the [final module of my MA](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-ecology-culture-society/), which was both intellectually and emotionally challenging. I found myself tearing through all kinds of literature to make sense of it — books and papers, fiction and non-fiction, audiobooks and podcasts, from dense academic texts to bestsellers. 

Come April, I had finished well over 30 books, and it seemed exciting to aim for 100.

I finished the year with 100 books over 25,607 pages.

  Of these, there were 55 non-fiction/45 fiction. 47 were audiobooks, thanks to Libby.<label for="sn-free-audiobooks" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

  <span class="sidenote">I remain perpetually astonished that Libby isn’t more widely used. It offers free audiobooks through libraries. I have both Barbican and my local council library for maximum selection.</span>

It was great, but I wouldn’t do it again. 

In the beginning, I read what I wanted (or needed) to. I wasn’t aiming for numbers and so it wasn’t influencing the choice of what I picked up. By September, trying to finish ~2 books a week on top of a full time job and a consistent training schedule was a lot of pressure. In the last few months, I found myself choosing shorter books and enjoying the act of reading a bit less. 

Still, it is exciting to look over the list and remember each of the books. My head feels absolutely _full_ of stories. No regrets. 

Reading is everything to me. It’s how I learn, how I process my feelings, how I make sense of the world. Books are an [axe for the frozen sea inside me](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/06/kafka-on-books-and-reading/).

As bell hooks says in [Teaching to Transgress](https://bellhooksbooks.com/product/teaching-to-transgress/)

> I came to theory because I was hurting—the pain within me was so intense that I could not go on living. I came to theory desperate, wanting to comprehend—to grasp what was happening around and within me. Most importantly, I wanted to make the hurt go away. I saw in theory then a location for healing.

True not just for theory.

Next year, I’ll be back to my normal 52 books. And picking up a few of those fat bricks, as a treat. 

Here are my roundups of the most memorable books of the year: [January-May](/digital-garden/book-roundup-jan-may-2023), [June-August](/digital-garden/book-roundup-june-aug-2023) and [September-December](/digital-garden/book-roundup-sept-dec-2023)
