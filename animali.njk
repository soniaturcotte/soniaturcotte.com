      <h1>Animali: A slow reading group</h1>

      <p class="small-text header">by <a href="/">sonia turcotte</a></p>
      <br> 
      <p>Animali is an online reading group meeting on the first Tuesday of every month. It will be an informal space for collectively reading about animals.</p>

      <p>It is open to anyone, with no prior reading or experience needed to join other than an interest in animals and reading with others. There is no expectation or requirement to attend all sessions.</p>

      <p>We read out loud together, stopping as desired to discuss the text, with no obligation to read or speak unless you want to. A copy of the text will be provided during the session.</p>
